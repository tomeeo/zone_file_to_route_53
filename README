DISCLAIMER:  Anyone using this script should have a solid understanding of DNS before using.  This script will sync zone records to Amazon's DNS Service (Route 53) and if you don't know what you are doing, you could screw something up.  

This is a utility script to help you manage DNS zones in AWS Route 53.

  The primary use is as follows:

Let's say you want your DNS zone managed by AWS but up until now you have been managing your own DNS records on your own nameserver.
You can use the "sync_zone_to_aws" script to push a local zone to AWS.

If you want to update an existing AWS zone using the zone files/formatting you are used to (Bind,named, etc), you can use this set of 
scripts as your interface to AWS Route 53.

HOW TO USE:

gem install fog
gem install dns-ruby

Get yourself an AWS account with Route 53 activated.  You will need to include your AWS ID and secret in the script.

In the script, replace constants appropriately:

### CONSTANTS FOR YOU TO CHANGE --> 
ZONES_DIR  = '/etc/bind/'
AWS_KEY_ID = "REPLACE WITH AWS KEY ID"
AWS_SECRET = "REPLACE WITH AWS SECRET"

Run it!

NOTE: the first argument is the zone domain and the second arg is the local zone file (it must reside in the "ZONES_DIR" - defined as a constant)
